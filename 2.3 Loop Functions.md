#Loop Functions

* lapply (function), sapply (funciton & simplified), apply (array), tapply (vector), mapply (multivariate)
* split 

##lapply
* lappy(x,FUN,..)
* x is a list, FUN is a function
* lapply(x, mean)
* lapply always returns a list
* rnomr(10) # random numbers up to 10
* runif #uniform distribution
* lapply(x,runif, min=0, max=10) #example
* lapply can use anonymous functions for example...
x <- list(a=matrix(1:4,2,2), b=matrix(1:6, 3, 2))
* lapply(x, function(elt) elt[,1])
* elt is an anonymous function that only exists during the lapply call above (the function returns first column)

##sapply
* simplifes result of lapply if possible
* can return vector or matrix if results simple enough, otherwise returns list
* compare outputs of the following, first is a list, second a vector as simpler
* x <- list(a=1:4, b =rnorm(10), c = rnorm(20,1), d = rnorm(100,5))
* lapply(x,mean)
* sapply(x,mean)
* 
##apply
* evaluate function array and usually anonymous function
* usually on matrix
* not faster than loops, just shorter syntax
* function(x, margin, fun,...)
* x is array, margin indicates integer on what should be retained, FUN is the function
* margin is 1 on rows, 2 on columns
* x <- matrix(rnorm(200),20,10)
* this creates a 20x10 matrix
* apply(x,1,mean) #does the mean on rows(1) so returns 20 results in the output
* apply(x,2,mean) #does the mean on columns(2) so returns 10 results in the output
* on matrices though you should use the following as optimised functions:
* rowSums, rowMeans, colSums, colMeans
* so for the above rowMeans(x) and colMeans(x) better
* calculate quartiles of each row...
* x <- matrix(rnorm(200),20,10)
* apply(x, 1, quantile, probs = c(0.25, 0.75))
* Returns 2x20 matrix of the original rows and the lower and upper percentile
* you can use apply with arrays
* a <- array(rnorm(2*2*10), c(2,2,10)) #so has three dimensions, a 2x2 matrix 10 times...
* apply(a,c(1,2), mean) #returns single 2x2 matrix which has means of the values across the 10 matrices
* 
* you can apply rowMeans to an array
