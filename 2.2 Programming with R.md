##Programming with R

#Control Structures
* Used for programming mainly
* if, else
* for
* while
* repeat
* break
* next 
* return

#Control Structures - if, else
* if() 
  {#do something}
  else
  {#do something else}
* Example different way of writing
* Sets y
y <- if(x>3)
    { 10 }
    else {3}
    
#Control Structures - for
* for(i in 1:10)
    {print (i)}
*The following all equivalent for x    
* x <- c("a", "b","c","d")
* for(i in 1:4)
  { print(x[i])}
* for(i in seq_along(x))
  { print(x[i])}
* for(letter in x)
  { print(letter)}
* You can nest for loops
* e.g. loop over rows then columns
* x <- matrix (1:6, 2, 3)
for(i in seq_len(nrow(x)))
{
  for(j in seq_len(ncol(x)))
    {
    print(x[i,j]
    }
}
* Don't nest too much as gets messy, use functions

#Control Structures - while
* count <- 0
while(count <10)
{
  print(count)
  count <- count+1
}
* You can test multiple conditions with && in control structures
* while(z>=3 && z <=10)
* Evaluates from left to right


#Control Structures = Repeat, Next, Break
* repeat a bit dangerous and could use for loop
* repeat starts an infinite loop until call break
* can use if within repeat to cause a break to get out of repeat loop
* repeat{#do something if(something) break}
* next can be used in any loop and used to skip an iteration
for(i in 1:100)
{
  if(i<=20)
  {
    ##skip first 20 iterations
    next
  }
  ##do something here
}
* return can also interrupt to and brings a value

#Your first R Function
* see in functions folder

#Functions Part 1
* f <- function(<args>) {#do}
* function is object, can pass to other functions,can nest
* arguments can be missing or default
* formals(f) #returns formal arguments of function
* args(f) #returns arguments of function
* Arguments can be match position or by name
* Arguments can be partially matched
* f(value1, value2)
* f(arg1 = value1, arg2 = value2)
* sd(vector) #standard deviation
* sd(airquality$Temp, na.rm = TRUE)
* lm(matrix) #linear model
* lm(airquality) #linear model

#Functions part 2
* NULL can be a default argument
* Lazy evaluation = only evaluated as needed
* "..." inherits arguments from other function
* e.g. for myplot using plot and inherit "..." so no need write all arguments
myplot <- function(x,y,type="l",...){
  plot(x,y,type=type,...
}
* Generic functions ... so can use methods
* ... also when dont know arguments in advance
* args(paste) #example has ... as first argument
* Basically dynamic arguments
* arguments after "..." must be named explicitly to work
* paste() #pastes together dynamic items
* paste("a","b", sep=":") #example

# Scoping Rules - Symbol Binding
* R tries to bind value to a symbol
* Searches through environments as dictated by search() function and binds when finds
* Does ".GlobalEnv" first then goes through package namespaces (as shown by search()), base package is always last
* Global environment is user namespace
* as seperate namespaces - can have an object named c and a function named c
* R uses lexical scoping or static scoping. Common alt is dynamic scoping.
* Those variables that are not in format argument of function but used in function are called free variables
* Environment is collection of (symbol, value) pairs, every environment has parent, enviro can have many children, empty enviro does not have parent
* function + environment = function closure
* Lexical scoping = searches through environments then parent environment etc, if not found (empty environment) then error

#Scoping Rules Continued
* Functions can have functions defined with them
* Constructor function - function makies a function
* Functions can return another function as its value
* ls(environment(function)) #returns what is in function environment
* functions can be free variables within other functions
* Lexical scoping looks up in environment where function defined
* Dynamic scoping - looked up in environment from where called
* When defined and called in same environment, lexical scoping can look like dynamic scoping
* Lexical scoping in other lang - Scheme, Perl, Python, Common Lisp
* Consequence of Lexical scoping (R):
* all objects stored in memory
* all functions must contain pointers to their environment

#Scoping Rules - Optimisation Example
* optimisation routines in R - optim, nlm, optimize - all require function who argument is vector of parameters
* "Constructor" function - create a functionm which takes a param to opimize
* defining environment held in memory so function knows where parameters come from - defining environment remember!
* Objective functions can have arguments built in so don't have to have lots of arguments when call every time
* as the arguments are held in the environment anyway

#Coding Standards for R
* Use text file / text editor
* Indent your code (4 spaces minimum, 8 spaces ideal)
* when using R script in R studio - Code option for preferences?
* Limit width of your code
* Limit length of individual functions
* Logical functions and use traceback, profiler, debugger functions you can find where problem occured - so easier to fix

#Dates and Times in R
* Date class
* POSIXct (a big integer) POSIXlt (a list) classes for time
* 1970-01-01 days or seconds since to calculate date or time in R
* e.g. run these in R unclass(as.Date("1970-01-01")), unclass(as.Date("1970-01-02"))
* as.Date("1970-01-01")
* Generic functions - weekdays(), months(), quarters()
* e.g. months(as.Date("1983-08-21"))
* Sys.time() #current time
* as.POSIXlt() #converts to this class
* p<- as.POSIXlt(Sys.time())
* names(unclass(p))
* p <- as.POSIXlt(Sys.time()); names(unclass(p)) #shows list of date and time components of POSIXlt class
* p <- as.POSIXct(Sys.time()); unclass(p) #brings back big integer for time
* p <- as.POSIXlt(Sys.time()); p$sec # returns seconds component
* can only get components from list (lt), so would have to cast from ct class if wanted to
* strptime() #can convert dates to same format
* ?strptime #to find the formats
* e.g.
* datestring <- c("August 21, 1983 10:58","December 25, 2015 12:00")
* x <-strptime(datestring, "%B %d, %Y %H:%M")
*  x #will see both formats same and something diff from above, they are in lt format
* Once in date or time classes can add, subtract or compare
* but cannot always mix classes so becareful
* date and time classes take care of leap years and time zones
* x <- Sys.Date(); y <- as.Date("1983-08-21"); x-y
* Plotting functions in R recognise date or time classes and format x axis in special way

#Quiz
* Parent frame in R is where funcion called
* Can get from ?parent.frame
* R environment is a collection of symbol/paris
* R uses lexical scoping
* Free variables in R are searched for in environment in which function defined
* Because of scoping rules in R all objects must be stored in memory
