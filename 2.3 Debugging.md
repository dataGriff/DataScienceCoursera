#Debugging

1. message
1. warning e.g. log(-1)
1. error
1. condition - can create your own

* Make sure you can recreate problem for effective solving
* State your expectations i.e. why is the result an error

##Debugging Tools

* traceback - prints out function callstack
* debug - can step through execution of function
* browser - suspends execution function and puts in debug mode
* trace - can insert debugging code into a function at specific places (can debug someone elses without actually editing it)
* recover - modify error behaviour, an error handler 

##Using the tools

* mean(x)
* traceback() ##has to be called immediately after error
* lm(y-x)
* traceback() ##shows an error 7 levels deep!

* debug(lm)
* lm(y-x) #starts debugging, shows entire function code
* have to type n then [Enter] which goes line by line until error arrives

* options(error = recover)
* read.csv("nosuchfile")
* returns callstack, which has numbered lines, then can type a number and press enter to invesitage that line
