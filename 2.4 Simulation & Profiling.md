##Simulation & Profiling

#The Str Function
* alternative to summary
* str(str) #Str tells you what is in this object
* x <- rnorm(100,2,4); str(x); summary(x) #str on a vector
* f <- gl(40,10); str(f); summary(f) #str on a vector
* library(datasets); str(airquality); summary(airquality) #str on airquality dataset
* m <- matrix(rnorm(100),10,10);str(m) #str on a matrix
* s <- split(airquality, airquality$Month); str(s) #str on each month of airquality

#Simulation
* Generating random numbers from probability distributions
* Functions probability distributions: rnorm, dnorm, pnorm, rpois
* d density, r random, p cumulative  ,q quantile, are the prefixes for the functions 
* require mean and standard deviation, defaults 0 and 1
* first parameter of function is number of variables you want
* lower.tail = TRUE does lower bit of standard dev, = FALSE does upper.tail
* set.seed(1) #important to set seed, especially when conduciting a simulation!
* rnorm(5) #if you reset the seed you get the same random 5 numbers
* ppois(2,2) #probability

#Simulate from a linear model (the y is the simulation of the linear model)
* set.seed(20); x<- rnorm(100); e <- rnorm(100,0,2); y <- 0.5+2 * x + e; summary(y); plot(x,y)
* Above generates the summary and plot of the simulation created, plot shows is relationship
* if is binary... 
* set.seed(10); x <- rbinom(100, 1, 0.5); e <- rnorm(100,0,2); y <- 0.5+2*x+e; summary(y); plot(x,y)
* plot looks different as x is binary but y is continuous
* If we want to make from a Poisson model
* set.seed(1); x<- rnorm(100); log.mu <- 0.5+0.3 * x; y <- rpois(100, exp(log.mu)); summary(y);plot(x,y)
* Looks like poisson and there is a relationship
