#Simulation & Profiling

##The Str Function
* alternative to summary
* str(str) #Str tells you what is in this object
* x <- rnorm(100,2,4); str(x); summary(x) #str on a vector
* f <- gl(40,10); str(f); summary(f) #str on a vector
* library(datasets); str(airquality); summary(airquality) #str on airquality dataset
* m <- matrix(rnorm(100),10,10);str(m) #str on a matrix
* s <- split(airquality, airquality$Month); str(s) #str on each month of airquality

##Simulation
* Generating random numbers from probability distributions
* Functions probability distributions: rnorm, dnorm, pnorm, rpois
* d density, r random, p cumulative  ,q quantile, are the prefixes for the functions 
* require mean and standard deviation, defaults 0 and 1
* first parameter of function is number of variables you want
* lower.tail = TRUE does lower bit of standard dev, = FALSE does upper.tail
* set.seed(1) #important to set seed, especially when conduciting a simulation!
* rnorm(5) #if you reset the seed you get the same random 5 numbers
* ppois(2,2) #probability
* Normal, Poisson, Binomial, Exponential, Gamma distributions etc

##Simulate from a linear model (the y is the simulation of the linear model)
* set.seed(20); x<- rnorm(100); e <- rnorm(100,0,2); y <- 0.5+2 * x + e; summary(y); plot(x,y)
* Above generates the summary and plot of the simulation created, plot shows is relationship
* if is binary... 
* set.seed(10); x <- rbinom(100, 1, 0.5); e <- rnorm(100,0,2); y <- 0.5+2*x+e; summary(y); plot(x,y)
* plot looks different as x is binary but y is continuous
* If we want to make from a Poisson model
* set.seed(1); x<- rnorm(100); log.mu <- 0.5+0.3 * x; y <- rpois(100, exp(log.mu)); summary(y);plot(x,y)
* Looks like poisson and there is a relationship
* 
##Simulation Random Sampling
* Here are some examples of how to generate random samples
* set.seed(1); sample(1:10,4); sample(1:10,4); sample(letters,5); sample(1:10); 
* sample(1:10); sample(1:10, replace=TRUE)
* replace option means can get repeats

##R Profile Part 1
* Examine and optimize your code
* Focus on where code spend most of its time
* Design first then optimise
* system.time() #time taken to evaluate expression
* user time - CPU, elapsed time - time you experience
* multi thread BLAS libaries
* Parallel package available
* system.time(readLines("http://www.jhsph.edu")) ##elapsed time > user time
* system.time can test blocks of code, but only useful when know where problem is

##R Profiler Part 2
* Rprof() starts profiler in R
* summaryRprof()) summarizes output from Rprof()
* DO NOT use system.time() and Rprof() the same time
* Sampling interval 0.02 seconds on function call stack
* summaryRprof(), 2 methods for normalizing the data, by.total, by.self
* self subtracts out lower level function calls
* total is by whole call
* Have to remember this as obviously everything happens in the top level function called (total)
* but the functions within it do all the work really
* $sample.interval, $sample.time
* Good to break your code into functions so that profiler can tell you where bottlenecks are
* C or Fortran code is not profiled

##Quiz Notes
* set.seed(1) always same random stuff produced
* rnorm generated standard normal random variables
* set.seed is important because
* Can generated non-uniform random numbers
* ensuresd sequence of numbers is truly random
* ensures random numbers start in specific place so reproducable
* rbinorm generates binomial random variables
* profiler keeps track of function call stack
* user time in syste.time is time spent by CPU
* if computer has more than one processor elapsed time may be smaller than user time
