## R Programming Background, Getting Started, and Nuts & Bolts

### Working directory and first scripts

* getwd() - this gets working directory
* this is where data gets read from or written to etc, so this is where R looks
* You can change it in the file menu "changedir" - I found this in "session"
* setwd("filepath") also sets directory in code
* dir() - this gets folder and files in a directory
* I set up my working directory in e.g. C:\Users\ri080230\Documents\Projects\DataScienceCoursera
* read.data("mycsv.csv") example to read data
* File > New File > R Script (to create new script)
* myfunction <- function(){
      x <- rnorm(100)
      mean(x)
}
* Ensure that there are no line spaces in the function
* Copy and paste the function into your console and press enter
* When you press ls() you will see the function ready to use

###Overview and History of R

* Derivative of S language
* R runs on pretty much anything, including the PS3!
* R stores stuff in physical memory so you need enough of this
* Base packages and recommended packages - come from CRAN
* There are a load more packages on CRAN and bioconductor project (genomic and biological) https://www.bioconductor.org/
* Documentation here: https://cran.r-project.org/
* https://www.r-project.org/doc/bib/R-books.html

##R Console Input and Evaluation
* <- assigns value to variable (vector)
* e.g. > x <- 5
* > x
* [1] 5 - the [1] is the first element of the vector
* # for comment
* x <- 1:20 #Creates a sequence

##R Data Types: Objects and attributes
* character, numeric, integer, complex, logical (bool)
* vector(class, length) ##Basic object, must be same class (datatypes), one exception is list
* 1 #would explicitly be numeric
* 1L #would explicitly be integer
* Inf #infinity
* NaN #Not a number e.g. 0/0 or missing value
* attributes() #names, dimnames, dimensions, class, length, UDF

##R Data Types: Vectors and Lists
* c(variable1, variable2) ##c is like concatenate so can make a vector
* x <- c(0.5,0.6) ##creates a numeric vector with 0.5 and 0.6
* x <- vector("numeric", length=10) #sets x to be ten zeroes as zero is default for numeric
* When mix data types does like SQL and finds lowest possible data type can use (numeric becomes text etc)
* as.numeric(x) #You can explicitly convert to data type using as.
* NA values will be return if try and convert what cant be converted
* x <- list(1, "a", TRUE, 1+4i) ##list can have mixed types

##R Data Types: Matrices
* Special type of vector, have a dimension attribute
* m <- matrix(nrow=2,ncol=3)
* dim(m) #returns number of columns and rows
* attributes(m) #returns the dim, as is first attribute
* m <- matrix(1:6,nrow=2,ncol=3)
* m <- 1:10 ##creates vector
* dim(m) <- c(2,5) ##creates matrix with 2 rows and 5 columns
* cbind(x,y) # column bind to create matrix
* rbind(x,y) # row bind to create matrix
