## R Programming Background, Getting Started, and Nuts & Bolts

### Working directory

* getwd() - this gets working directory
* this is where data gets read from or written to etc, so this is where R looks
* You can change it in the file menu "changedir" - I found this in "session"
* setwd("filepath") also sets directory in code
* dir() - this gets folder and files in a directory
* I set up my working directory in e.g. C:\Users\ri080230\Documents\Projects\DataScienceCoursera
* read.data("mycsv.csv") example to read data
* File > New File > R Script (to create new script)
* myfunction <- function(){
      x <- rnorm(100)
      mean(x)
}
* Ensure that there are no line spaces in the function
* Copy and paste the function into your console and press enter
* When you press ls() you will see the function ready to use
